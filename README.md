=============

## What is this repo?

This repository is a place to experiment and document experimentation so I can

* Remember what I've done
* Trial experiments in more than a hello world app
* Show other people so I have some context when talking about application architecture

## What does it do?

Nothing actually useful.  But it does demonstrate how I'd build an application that has these characteristics:

* Its user-access agnostic (it's not just a web app)
* It's got X-Factor scale (yes, the TV show)
* It always knows what happened
* It's cheap and fast to experiment with
* It can deploy to production in under 1 hour from code commit
* It expects to change
* It's resistant to failure
* It knows where its vulnerabilities are
* It's usable by anyone, regardless of physical ability or language

You can read more about each of these 

## You had me at 'Nothing actually useful', where do I read more?

Read the docs, or jump into the architecture decision records to see the journey
